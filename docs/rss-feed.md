title: RSS Feed for Content
---

RSS 2.0 feed support is available as of MarkdownMaster CMS 5.0.3 for all content types
and links in the default blog and wiki themes have been added.

To access these feeds, append `.rss` to your content type.
For example if your site has `reviews`, `pages`, and `posts` as types:

* `yoursite.tld/reviews.rss` -> RSS feed for reviews
* `yoursite.tld/pages.rss` -> RSS feed for pages
* `yoursite.tld/posts.rss` -> RSS feed for posts
