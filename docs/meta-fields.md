MarkdownMasterCMS supports a number of meta fields automatically for pages.
These get generated by the server to be available for bots and crawlers.

## Description

Pulled from the description, excerpt, or first paragraph of the page.

## Author

Simple author name pulled from the `author` field in frontmatter.
Whatever value is set is the value that is rendered.

## Canonical

The canonical URL of the page generated automatically based on the site URL and page path.

## Image

Pulled from the `image` field in frontmatter and useful for displaying a preview of the page content in social feeds.

## Fediverse Creator

Generated in combination with the `author` field in frontmatter and the `authors` page type.
The author listed in the page MUST match either the title or the alias of an author in the `authors/` directory.

The value provided to crawlers is the `mastodon` key within the `socials` field of the author file.

Example:

my-blog-post.md:

```markdown
---
title: My Blog Post
author: Alice Smith
---
```

authors/alice.md:

```markdown
---
title: Alice Smith
alias: alice
socials:
    mastodon: https://social.veraciousnetwork.com/@alice
---
```

In the above example, either "alice" or "Alice Smith" would work as the author value in the page frontmatter,
depending on how you'd prefer the base author meta tag to be rendered.
Both will pull alice.md and retrieve the mastodon URL for the fediverse creator meta tag.
