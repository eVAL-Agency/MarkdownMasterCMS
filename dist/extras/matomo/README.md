## Initialization

To load this plugin, add the following to the `extras` block in your
[config.php](https://markdownmaster.com/docs/site-configuration.html) or
theme [settings.php](https://markdownmaster.com/docs/theme-development.html):

```php
'extras' => [
    // ...
    
    'matomo' => [],
    
    // ...
],
```


## Additional Required Scripts

For most reliable results, Matomo expects additional scripts to be loaded in the `<head>`
section of the theme.  This snippet is probably wrapped with `<!-- Matomo -->` ...
`<!-- End Matomo Code -->`.

The `Image Tracking` option can be placed in a `<noscript>` tag at the end of the theme
to track users who have disabled JavaScript.
